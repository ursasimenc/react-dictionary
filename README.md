# Frontend Mentor - Password generator app solution

This is a solution to the [To Do app challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/todo-app-Su1_KokOW). I have made some adjustments to the design.

## The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Add new todos to the list
- Mark todos as complete
- Delete todos from the list
- Filter by all/active/complete todos
- Clear all completed todos
- Toggle light and dark mode

The solution was built using Solid.js, TypeScript and Sass and uses localStorage to store the tasks in the browser.
